# GUI Package

The GUI directory implements the web interface built with NiceGUI. `application.py` starts the application and wires together controllers, sensors and visual components. Subpackages provide reusable GUI elements like live plots and webcam streams, along with tab components for dashboards, experiment setup and logging.
