# Utilities Package

This folder collects general purpose helpers used across the project. Modules under `config_utils`, `log_utils`, and `concurrency` provide configuration management, structured logging, and async/thread execution helpers. `data_utils` contains persistence and compression helpers, while `alert_system_utils` and `container.py` implement email alerts and dependency management services.
